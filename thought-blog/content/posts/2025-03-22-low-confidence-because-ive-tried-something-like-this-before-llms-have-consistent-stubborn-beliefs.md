ðŸ’­ low confidence because I've tried something like this before. llms have consistent (stubborn?) beliefs due to consistent identity. This is why its often better to back up rather than argue. It may be useful to have the llm believe it is new, replacing the previous llm, not the same llm continuing the chat. Possibly do that only after a critique llm sees an issue. Problem I had last time is you'd get a right answer, critique bot would flag it, and itd get replaced with a wrong (and usually more complicated) answer.
