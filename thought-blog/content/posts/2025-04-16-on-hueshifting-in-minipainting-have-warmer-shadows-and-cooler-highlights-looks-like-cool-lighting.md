On hueshifting in minipainting
- have warmer shadows and cooler highlights (looks like cool lighting), or cool shadows and warm highlights (looks like warm lighting)
- pick something other than black and white to mix with your main tone to make the shadows and highlights, or add another color as well as black/white
- for things like skin, starting with reddish tones and then painting more typical skin colors on top can look realistic with little effort.
If you change your mind and don't like a highlight color or something, you can pretty easily just glaze over it and shift the hue back toward the midtone
