💭 automatic feedback via stylometric analysis? Doesn't exactly give advice but maybe suggests where to find problems.
I wonder if stylometrics for music are established. Every time I've tried to compress music to stats and patterns I've quickly found a brick wall given how many ways those patterns could be expressed and obfuscated.
