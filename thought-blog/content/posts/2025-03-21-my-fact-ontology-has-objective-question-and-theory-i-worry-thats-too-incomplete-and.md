ðŸ’­ my fact ontology has objective, question, and theory. I worry that's too incomplete and worry that adding more types will make things less usable to the llm. Are problem and possible solution useful subtypes? Procedural knowledge like how to navigate between two known locations doesn't fit any current fact types either.
