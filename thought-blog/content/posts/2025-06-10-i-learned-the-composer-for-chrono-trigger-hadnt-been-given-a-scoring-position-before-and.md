ðŸ’­ I learned the composer for chrono trigger hadn't been given a scoring position before, and had been waiting so long he threatened to quit over it. When he was put to scoring chrono trigger it looked like they only opportunity he might get, and he worked himself into the hospital over it, and at one point lost a hard drive with 40 songs.
