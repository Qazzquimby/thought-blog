💭 so whats the lowest fidelity way to make a class based fps like tf2 or overwatch that feels good?
Can 3d modeling be avoided somehow? Sprite based animations might be actually worse though particularly if supporting many angles / above and below. 
Is there some unexpected way to get silhouette and character and aesthetic almost for free?
