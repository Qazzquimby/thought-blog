ðŸ’­ previously looked at llm social deduction game plays as real time, but hypothetically what if it was play by post and (outside of synchronous conversations throughout the day) there was basically unlimited reasoning time, limited by some budget. Could leave the paradigm of "think between messages". Is there a way to get very slow llms for a considerable discount?
