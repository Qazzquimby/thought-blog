ðŸ’­ solo rpgs seem like they'd be perfect for me (having far more games to play than players) but a main aspect I care about is trying to reason about the world and figure things out. Solo games usually randomly generate answers to hidden info as needed which screws any attempt to solve the world like a puzzle.
