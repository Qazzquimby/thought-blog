ðŸ’­ llm generates mechanics/systems, generates orthogonally interesting entities that interact with each other and the systems, simulates things in an auto dwarf fortress way. Becomes a prompt based text adventure probably with a limited action vocab where the player needs to read the generated wiki to learn the environment.
