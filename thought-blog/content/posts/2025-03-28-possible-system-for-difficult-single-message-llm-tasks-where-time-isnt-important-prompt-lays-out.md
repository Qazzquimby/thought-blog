ðŸ’­ possible system for difficult single-message llm tasks where time isnt important
- Prompt lays out requirements
- run n r1 instances
- sonnet 3.5 new with prompt + r1 outputs makes a final output

in some cases may instead want a sonnet to give the r1's jobs and recompile. R1 is actually a better plan maker sometimes so could chain the whole thing.
