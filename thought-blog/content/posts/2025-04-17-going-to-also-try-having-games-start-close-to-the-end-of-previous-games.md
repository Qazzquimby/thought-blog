ðŸ’­ going to also try having games start close to the end of previous games because positions near the ends of games should be easier to learn (closer to the value signal) and intuitively I feel like that should produce a visible learning curve faster. It's kind of like whatever that technique is where you give gradually harder versions of the problem.
