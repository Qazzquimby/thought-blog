ðŸ’­ muzero learns to simulate the game in it's head rather than using a game simulator provided to it. The main power to this is it means the game can be very slow to simulate and the model could still simulate it quickly. In particular this means you don't have to worry about keeping the game state performance optimized. You can freely translate the state to whatever might be most useful for the ai.
