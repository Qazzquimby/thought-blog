ðŸ’­ Other day I said multiplayer games would be more fun if you could play all the positions yourself.
Opposite: Take any game with a clear consistent objective, split it into bits like "5 seconds of gameplay" or "1 turn". Players are assigned such snippets of game to play.
Should be immune to matchmaking issues because its so asynchronous.
Obvious issues where you don't clearly get any feedback since you're usually not the one playing the winning move, and the course of the game is highly diluted with other players to blame, and you're playing so many separate games you can't be attached to any of them. You can see an average win rate of the games youve played though. 

Coincidentally this is very similar to the performance parallelization for alphazero I did.
