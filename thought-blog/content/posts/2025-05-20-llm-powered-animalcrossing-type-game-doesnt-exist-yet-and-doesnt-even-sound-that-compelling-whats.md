ðŸ’­ llm powered animalcrossing type game doesn't exist yet and doesn't even sound that compelling. What's missing? I think answer maybe its the same sorts of things rimworld uses for emergent storytelling. Animalcrossing is extremely static, but you could easily have two characters not like each other, or someone get sick, or one character trying to uncover another's secret. Underground demon cult. My technique for making stories happen in sandbox campaigns is to have npc groups with competing agendas and make everything connect densely with multiple groups to pull them together.
