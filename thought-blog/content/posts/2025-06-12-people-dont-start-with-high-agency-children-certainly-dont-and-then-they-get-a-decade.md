ðŸ’­ People don't start with high agency. Children certainly don't, and then they get a decade or so of school which I'd argue discourages agency at every  turn. Then suddenly they're released and expected to create a meaningful life and successful career and all, but what they've practiced is doing what everyone else is doing and not thinking too hard about why.
