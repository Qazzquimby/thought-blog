💭 discrete outputs are a truer representation of a discrete game though, it'd just somehow need to learn an absurdly large codebook. One item per state is stupid. Maybe it could predict multiple separate discrete outputs and combine them somehow. Technically it could predict a variable size state representation like a series of tokens but that sounds too expensive.
