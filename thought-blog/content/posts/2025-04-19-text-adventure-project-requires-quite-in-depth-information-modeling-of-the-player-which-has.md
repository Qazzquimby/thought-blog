ðŸ’­ text adventure project requires quite in depth information modeling of the player which has to be remembered long term.
Imagine you see an npc on the street and it's described like "you see Charles the grocer" when you should have no idea who he is yet.
Or if its not memorized properly then you could have married Charles and saved the world with him and he could be described like "A mustached man with an orange sweater"

This requires the llm to accurately track state over long periods of time, and we know how good they are at that!
