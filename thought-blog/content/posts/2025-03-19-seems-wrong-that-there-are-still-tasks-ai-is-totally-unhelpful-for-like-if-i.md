Seems wrong that there are still tasks ai is totally unhelpful for. Like if I wanted to make a rivals or aether character I'd have to do all the art myself since image gen can't handle doing the same character as pixel art matching an art style in different parts of various animations, and do all the code myself because roa coding is too niche for an llm to do any good. Could maybe improve the code part by providing lots of example context but the art is no where near doable
