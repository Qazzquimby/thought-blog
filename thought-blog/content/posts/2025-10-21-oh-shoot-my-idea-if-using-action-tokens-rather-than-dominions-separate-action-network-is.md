ðŸ’­ oh shoot my idea if using action tokens rather than dominions separate action network is the Dominion method can handle hierarchical actions (choose card then choose target then choose x etc) iteratively without recomputing the big network whereas id need to either make an action token for each step which sounds complicated and lossy or rerun the transformer encoder on the new tokens. Woe. Not sure if that idea is shot dead.
