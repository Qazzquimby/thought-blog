ðŸ’­ hype, listen up. I'm pretty sure that the idea simplest representation of a game state for a transformer model is exactly the same as the simplest representation in a relational DB. Can provide examples. This means, I think, that any state written in a relational DB with meaningful types and constraints could be easily(?) turned into a heterogeneous graph transformer for policy value. Slow sim time won't matter much if using muzero. Can automatically track changes for undo or networking.
