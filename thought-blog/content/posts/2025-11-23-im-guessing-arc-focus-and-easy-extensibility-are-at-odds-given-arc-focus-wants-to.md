💭 I'm guessing arc focus and easy extensibility are at odds given arc focus wants to pull things to a close and want events on the way to tie in heavily. There's only so much you can reasonably do to support one arc at which point new content must just be filler. Filler can be fine but is subtracting from the arc.
