ðŸ’­ liberty launcher was designed to work with reserve shooter and market gardener. It sort of works with gardener because of lower self damage, but it's changes largely feel like they have unintended drawbacks. Having an irregular projectile speed for example makes using it actively harmful to muscle memory.

Liberty launcher:
Adjust speed to match direct hit so muscle memory transfers.
Adjust kb to match direct hit (scaled by damage difference)
Damage possibly lowered further.
Damage increased while rocket jumping. Possibly minicrit.
Possibly increased reload speed because "more total time spent reloading" usually feels like it was an unintended aspect of valves increased clip size weapons.
Could possibly also minicrit airborne targets, making it function like both reserve and gardener, though it's unenhanced damage would need to be pretty dismal.

This would hopefully make it a high floor heigh ceiling weapon designed for rollouts, bombing, and juggling.
