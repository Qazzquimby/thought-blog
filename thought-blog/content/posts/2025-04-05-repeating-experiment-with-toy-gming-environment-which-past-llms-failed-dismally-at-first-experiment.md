ðŸ’­ repeating experiment with toy GMing environment which past llms failed dismally at. First experiment (idk which llm) couldn't keep state consistent or follow instructions. Second experiment I think with sonnet3.5old didn't work because sonnet3.5old hated fun 'even in the context of a roleplaying game'. Gemini seems to just do it. Maybe 3.7 would as well.
