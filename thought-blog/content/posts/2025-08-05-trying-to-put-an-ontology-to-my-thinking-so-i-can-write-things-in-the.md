ðŸ’­ trying to put an ontology to my thinking so I can write things in the right place. There seems to be a blurry line between project and idea. For example, making a bunch of new wiz war cards is a project. Making a wiz war card that makes gravity go sideways like a 2d platformer is an idea. Making a set of 5 related wiz war cards is somewhere between those.
I think should be handled by linking to notes
