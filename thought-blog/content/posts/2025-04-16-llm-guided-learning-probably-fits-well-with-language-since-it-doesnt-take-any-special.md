ðŸ’­ Llm guided learning probably fits well with language since it doesn't take any special interfacing for the llm to see what you're doing and they're domain experts. Obviously still needs wrapping to teach effectively.
Aside, I wonder if learning languages will become low value. Translation jobs are already gone, and I expect at some point you'll have low latency audio translation. Though there's a ceiling there, given word order and stuff, you couldn't ever translate each word as its spoken.
