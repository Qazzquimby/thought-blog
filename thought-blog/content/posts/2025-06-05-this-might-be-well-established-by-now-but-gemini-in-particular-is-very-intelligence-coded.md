ðŸ’­ this might be well established by now, but gemini in particular is very intelligence coded. It tries very hard to make an answer that looks smart even if it sacrifices quality. In code this manifests as things like variable names containing 0 value words, and unhealthy obsession with error checks. Older llms would pretend problems were highly nuanced as a way to hedge our of giving an answer. Gemini pretends problems are highly nuanced so it can give a complicated answer instead of a simple one.
