ğŸ’­ board game ai engine.
Get better with transformer architecture
Figure out if there's a reason graph transformers can't perform sufficiently or can't express arbitrarily complex games.
If they're capable, get very comfortable with that architecture as well, and rewrite the engine to represent everything(?) with graph transformers
