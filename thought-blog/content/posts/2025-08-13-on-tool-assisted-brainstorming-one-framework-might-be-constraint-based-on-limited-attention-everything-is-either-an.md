ðŸ’­ on tool assisted brainstorming, one framework might be

Constraint based on limited attention:
Everything is either an individual or collection. Anything 'named' or user facing comes is either unique or belongs to a small collection (2-5 contrasting items), or is attached to something in a small collection. You could have millions of people/magic items but the only people/items that matter would be either the three warring politicians, or the magic item belonging to a character in a small collection like that.

As a graph with long texts, wikilike:
Enqueue pages to create
When handling a page, enqueue jobs
Jobs are 
- brainstorm general impact, importance, why a viewer would care. Both individuals and collections have this
- If the page is a collection, brainstorm contrasting members, enqueued as new pages. Pests -> rats
- If the page is an individual, optionally create a collection page and enqueue. Rats -> pests
- For some graph based relevance search find likely links already in the graph. Also find some random distant links because those are fun. Any of those may be created as links. Ideal graph is densely connected with diverse relationships that create conflict. This is likely done in multiple steps, first finding connections and then fleshing them out.

Queue is automatically handled.
At each step an llmy system could list point form proposals.
Unsure, but it might be beneficial to start with a relationship before creating a new page. Rather than making two entities and relating them, have an entity and create another specifically to relate to them, like how foils are made for characters. Not sure how that fits in.
