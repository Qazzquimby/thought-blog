ðŸ’­ which operations can an llm easily perform on text that it can then consistently undo?
Which could a human not do?
Which transformations can an llm understand immediately without added context?

Eg an llm can rewrite text as ascii hex, and the same llm can read that ascii hex just fine without context explaining what it is.

What is this useful for..?
