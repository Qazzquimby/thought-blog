ðŸ’­ my understanding is that muzero does need access to the game (else there is no ground truth) but doesn't need to run sims of the game internally. It simulates the game via imagining the mechanics with a model.
So that's going to be faster due to not needing game deep copies and actual game sim, and slower because more to train
