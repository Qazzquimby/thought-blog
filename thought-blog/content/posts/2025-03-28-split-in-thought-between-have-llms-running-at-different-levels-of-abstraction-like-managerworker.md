ðŸ’­ split in thought between
- have llms running at different levels of abstraction, like manager/worker, or zoomed out/zoomed in, possibly n tiers.
- single llm with a system encouraging it to give up and not scope creep subobjectives. I think this begs the question of how, and the answer might be the first option.
