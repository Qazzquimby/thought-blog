ðŸ’­ with llms as helpers for thinking, I wonder if they could also help instill mental habits. There are many helpful habits that are just hard to install without effort and repetition, and maybe it'd help to make them part of the system prompt so you'd be regularly exposed to them. Eg don't think of something as impossible without at least dedicating some minutes to find a way, don't do things that you'd see as stupid if someone else did them, etc
