ðŸ’­ on long term memory system, after much planning and replanning, a simple "every 10 messages, ask the llm to check up if this is the best thing they could be doing" seems to be handling things pretty well.
This won't scale up indefinitely since the memory system only gets tested when there's too much critical info to keep in the immediate context, but it's doing a lot of good for virtually no cost.
