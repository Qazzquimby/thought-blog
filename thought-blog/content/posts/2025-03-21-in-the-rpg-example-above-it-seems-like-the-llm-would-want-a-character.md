ðŸ’­ In the rpg example above it seems like the llm would want a character sheet. A self contained way of tracking things that need tracking. How does that generalize? There's no hard rule for what is "temporary" or is "worth tracking" or is important enough to go in a bundle of commonly seen information. Your character's age hardly needs to be part of a regularly recalled character sheet yet it is known to go out of date.
