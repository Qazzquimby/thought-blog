💭 I'm not hogwild about writing but I want to have broader capabilities than I do, so I'll hard focus a different skill every two months or so and try to break through the skill floors. I have a problem where I get stuck extremely easily: I think of a question I need to answer, I fail to think of a satisfactory answer in a few minutes of brainstorming, and I switch tasks to passive consumption. I've got to kill that somehow for this to work. Debugging and planning programming tasks feel more like following a trail, while these problems feel like trying to generate an answer from nothing.
