ðŸ’­ importance should be tracked separately. More important things should be tracked more carefully. Need to figure out under which cases a fact could be out of date without any way of noticing that's so. For example "I used timestop today" is recorded and then a week later the fact comes back in memory. The fact itself doesn't specify which day "today" is so there is insufficient context to determine if it has expired.
