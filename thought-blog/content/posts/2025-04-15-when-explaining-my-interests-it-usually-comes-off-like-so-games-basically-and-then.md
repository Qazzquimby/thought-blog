ðŸ’­ when explaining my interests it usually comes off like "so games basically" and then I feel kind of shallow
I think the reason most of my projects are at least tangentially related to games (or simulations resembling games) is
- emergent complexity comes easily in diverse simplified environments with concrete mechanics, which is basically games
- decision optimization or other agent improvement needs a test environment, which is probably a game or something like it
- a lot of communities or missing tools in need of a programmer are related to games
- as soon as you add interactivity to a world it becomes a game
- as soon as you add programming to a world it becomes a sim, which is just ui away from being a game
probably more
