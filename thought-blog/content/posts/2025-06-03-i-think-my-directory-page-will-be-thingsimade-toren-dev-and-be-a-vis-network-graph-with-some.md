ðŸ’­ I think my directory page will be thingsimade.toren.dev and be a vis-network graph with some nodes being category, represented by a word, and other nodes being projects, represented by a titled image. Clicking a node updates a side panel explaining it and linking to the project.

I previously thought of a moving masonry grid where panels fit a grid rather than being horizontally or vertically aligned and the panels resize and slide around every now and then, but that doesn't provide any kind of organization.
Also previously prototyped a spinning dial selector UI, basically scrolling but with rotation, but thats also not good for finding anything in particular. I should really start with function rather than whatever sounds neat.
