ðŸ’­  Trying to be less blind to music theory so I can write music again more intentionally than last time, and thought I'd analyze the smb overworld.
The very first chord is an out of key 'secondary dominant', the V chord of the V chord of the main key, and replaces the 5th with the 9th for interest.
I think there's a lesson that everything is more complicated than I expect, even when I expect it to be complicated.
