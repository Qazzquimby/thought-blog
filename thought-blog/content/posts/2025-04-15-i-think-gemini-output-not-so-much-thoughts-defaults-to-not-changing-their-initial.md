ðŸ’­ I think gemini (output, not so much thoughts) defaults to not changing their initial answer, like I mentioned earlier. It might correlate with gemini being more likely to be correct, but I think it defends bad answers approximately as much. Recently I asked for something, it answered, then I clarified what I needed such that its answer was no longer appropriate, and it still focused on defending its first answer - given the original question. This seems like another point where making the llm think previous messages came from another user and its a new arrival may help break up patterns in behavior
