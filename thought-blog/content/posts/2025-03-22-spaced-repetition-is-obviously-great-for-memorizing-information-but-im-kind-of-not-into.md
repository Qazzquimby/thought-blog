ðŸ’­ spaced repetition is obviously great for memorizing information, but I'm kind of not into memorizing information. I find that if I don't remember something, its usually because I haven't needed it in practice, and I can just look it up when I do need it. Drilling something isn't worthwhile if I spend more total time drilling than I would take looking it up across all times I need it.
Anyway spaced repetition is still how memory forms, so I imagine the ideal way to structure learning projects is to make sure skills you're learning are demanded along the same rate as the forgetting curve. To learn many things you'd want to interleave them where new subjects are practiced proportionally more often
