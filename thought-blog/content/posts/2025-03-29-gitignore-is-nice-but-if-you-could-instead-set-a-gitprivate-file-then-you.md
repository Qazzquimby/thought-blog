ðŸ’­ gitignore is nice, but if you could instead set a gitprivate file then you could upload a private and public version of the same repository, so that your env file could be easily backed up and transferred between workspaces. I'm sure it'd get more complicated with collaborators but even a simple implementation would mean you could potentially use git + something like LFS for general backups
