initing context for blog:
- Currently working on a long term memory system that's less underengineered than those I've seen so far.
- Have a universal board game ai project. Was previously stumped when I realized arbitrarily nested zones didn't sound like they'd fit into ml, but I now think a graph nn might be able to do it and want to see if it's good enough.
- Pray is an immersive sim ttrpg I get hyped about then get stumped on some issue and stop without really making progress
- tabletop teamfight is a tactics boardgame so I can see how abilities from different games would interact. 
- I'll eventually get back to trying to get llms good at social deduction games
