💭 content testing. Define content as any kind of value, and assume it needs to have certain arbitrary properties to be correct. For example a name should be capitalized and maybe should have at least one space, and an age should be nonnegative, and words in a long text should match dictionary entries.

Like software testing, when an issue is encountered, can write or generate a test for it to auto detect in future. I'm particularly thinking about precise content where the rules are many and hard to remember, like writing mtg cards.
