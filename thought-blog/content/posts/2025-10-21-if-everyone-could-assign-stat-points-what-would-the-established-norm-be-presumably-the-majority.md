ðŸ’­ if everyone could assign stat points, what would the established norm be? Presumably the majority in the past would go into physical stats while now most would go into mental stats. If everyone's stats are visible maybe all in mental would be seen as necessary to be a serious employee, or maybe "wasted" stats would be a form of costly value signaling.
