ðŸ’­ Difficult social deduction game play has other problems besides high cost of course.
- Open ended (not turn based) chat seems pretty awkward when everyone is basically writing emails to each other, but shorter messages are far more expensive given input processing. I guess that's supposed to be what llm caching is for(?) but I've never succeeded at saving money with llm caching.
- Need to seriously r&d the problem solving counterfactuals aspect of it because the difficulty of the game is such that they're rapidly just hallucinating confidence and confusing themselves.
