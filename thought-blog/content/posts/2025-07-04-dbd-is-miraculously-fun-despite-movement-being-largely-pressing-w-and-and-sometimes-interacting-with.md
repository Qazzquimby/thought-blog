ðŸ’­  dbd is miraculously fun despite movement being largely pressing W and and sometimes interacting with windows and things to create distance.
If movement was actually fun and diverse you could probably make a whole game about tag. Tf2 soldier tag would have a very high and expressive skill ceiling and there's lots of room for interesting movement abilities.

Maybe map with n people. Someone is somehow non-randomly made 'it' which drains health and grants substantial extra mobility. 'it' is passed on hit.
That'd mostly promote hiding and being disengaged so might want to replace last-man-standing with a different objective and or use a central capture point.
