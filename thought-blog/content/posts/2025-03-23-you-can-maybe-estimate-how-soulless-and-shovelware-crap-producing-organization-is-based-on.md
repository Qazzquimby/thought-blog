ðŸ’­ you can maybe estimate how soulless and shovelware crap producing organization is based on 'how much of the decision making is based on passion vs profit maximization'
which itself could be derived out of
- how much someone applying to work there probably cares 
- how much voice those people have
So it trends to 0 as the company grows larger and more tied to investment and management tiers. Can probably roughly say that passion is inversely proportional to profitability, at least with a team above a certain size
