Gemini leaves a lot of comments, and I posted that silly example, but I think theyre actually pretty good comments most of the time. I tend towards using as few comments as possible, but if I'm more open minded

- the ---block--- comments and other section delineaters clearly show where related code should go *in future* which is possibly useful for helping the project grow cleanly
- most of the other comments say something non trivial. Rather than saying what the line does, the comments focus on why the line exists (though its a grey area).

I optimistically theorize that these comments might improve the success rate of future changes. Even if they don't help me understand the code (and they might) they may be valuable just by helping the future llm understand the code. I can always strip them later.
