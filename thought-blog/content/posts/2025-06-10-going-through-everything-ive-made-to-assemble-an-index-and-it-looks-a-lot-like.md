ðŸ’­ Going through everything I've made to assemble an index, and it looks a lot like pretty much everything I made was in the last 5 years. Everything I can think of or find in github or notes is 2020+, with a couple outliers in 2018 related to overwatch automation.
Start of 2020 is when I graduated sfu. So pretty much everything that's come from my time that I value came from after I stopped having my time wasted in school.
