ðŸ’­ gemini making far fewer mistakes means its easier to analyze the mistakes it does make (or at least they feel more notable).
I'd say theyre largely either
- using some hallucinated fact or figure. Probably very reasonable looking.
- less commonly, missing a common sense check while reasoning, and making a bad extrapolation.
It is too slow to question its previous results or the accuracy of its beliefs, which can cause rabbitholes. It's possible identity changes could cause it to be more critical of those assumptions, or maybe not because of how they're written in as implicitly true.
