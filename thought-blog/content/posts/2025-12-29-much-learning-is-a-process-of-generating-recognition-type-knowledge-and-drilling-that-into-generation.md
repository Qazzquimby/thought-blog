💭 much learning is a process of generating recognition type knowledge and drilling that into generation (more general form of recall) type knowledge. Eg want to learn to draw, first need to recognize what makes one picture better than another in your eyes, then generate pictures with those properties. Feels like this model should be useful but I don't see how.
