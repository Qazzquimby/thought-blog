💭 I need me a taxonomy of board game mechanics at the smallest level. In mtg "target creature has +3/+3 until end of turn" makes sense but "target player has +3 health until end of turn" doesn't. Theyre different types of numbers or they have different properties? How many are there? What are the absolute constraints of when x vs while x? Can any programmed system have truly arbitrary event handling?
