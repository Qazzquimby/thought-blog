ðŸ’­ Say you can't finetune but need to do styletransfer. Naive few shot prompting has some degree of success but is obviously not optimized.
Could you optimize few shot prompting and could that be cheaper and more portable than finetuning?
Might need to tune an adversarial model to determine how good the transfer is which sounds like a funny way to not make things cheaper.
