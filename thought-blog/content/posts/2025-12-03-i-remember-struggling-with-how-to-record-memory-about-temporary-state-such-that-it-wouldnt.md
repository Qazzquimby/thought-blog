💭 I remember struggling with how to record memory about temporary state such that it wouldn't become confusing later when the state became untrue. Maybe such state could be defining and setting a variable (eg location). Still need to avoid reading outdated data.
Could try to trigger an update as soon as it becomes untrue somehow but that sounds very heavyhanded.
Could try to standardize what kinds of state are tracked so next time a location is noted it updates the value (rather than the old memory needing to be marked no longer true)
Could also treat state memories that haven't been set for a while as suspect and ask for them to be confirmed which will hopefully happen while the value change is still in context so it knows the answer.
