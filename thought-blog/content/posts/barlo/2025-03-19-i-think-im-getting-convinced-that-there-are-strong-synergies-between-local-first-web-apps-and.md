I think I'm getting convinced that there are strong synergies between local-first web apps and llm tooling:
- local-first web apps are essentially ephemeral software. download the ui and logic right before use. blow away everything except the persisted store (if there is one)
- if you can retrieve a webapp, you can ping an llm. if the user pays for the llm api themself, the dev has no risk if the system prompt is modified. it's a surprisingly DIY ethos to a "backend"
