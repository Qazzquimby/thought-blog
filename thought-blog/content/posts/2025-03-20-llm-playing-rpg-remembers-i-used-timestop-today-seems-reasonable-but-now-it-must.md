ðŸ’­ llm playing rpg remembers "I used timestop today". Seems reasonable but now it must remember to clear that memory next day, which isn't super likely because itd rely on the memory consolidation that handles the new day starting also having that fact determined as relevant enough for the context.
This seems like a big issue.
- temporary facts should include expiry condition thats easy to check at any point in future? idk how to make sure thats true
- temporary facts should create a 'listener' and in all(?) future consolidations that listener's condition should be checked?
