ðŸ’­ rough thought that llms expanding something from a summary is like diffusion generation. Could maybe be good recursively on demand for arbitrary depth. Hard to say what context is needed because id expect other branches of the generation tree to have relevant info which makes it sound intractable. Could maybe be trained to undo "summarize" instructions.
