💭 soldier launcher
You and enemies launched by kb from this have 30% less gravity. While rmb is held, changes to +30% gravity.
Some downside that doesn't affect kb at all.

Synergy with airshots as enemies are floaty, better rollouts, possibly makes mantread kills doable, probably not good with gardener unless rmb works even while not held
