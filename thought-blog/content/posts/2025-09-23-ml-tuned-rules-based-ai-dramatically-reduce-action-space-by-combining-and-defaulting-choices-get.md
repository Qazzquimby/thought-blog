ðŸ’­ ml tuned rules based ai? Dramatically reduce action space by combining and defaulting choices. Get a few attributes of the game state to predict value from for a simpler weaker model if possible. Maybe do without hidden info and rng handling for performance. I can't think of a way to avoid sim overhead without learning a simulation model so hopefully it's enough to just do few sims.
