ðŸ’­ I thought my rivals assistant was largely unknown, but I also have an automatic git backup of many rivals mods, and searching all their source codes at once shows lots of notable mods/modders are using it. Neat.
Looks like nearly everyone is just using the sprite exporting part, but that's okay.
