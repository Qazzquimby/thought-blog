ðŸ’­ doing a pytorch course
finding it useful to 
- write my solution
- try to look for improvements or at least note places that seem like they could be done better, even if I don't know how
- look at the answer and analyze how they did it different
- get gemini to compare them (without indicating which is mine) for best practices, to show where mine is worse versus where its just different
